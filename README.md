# Project Name
  . Wolfi_PyCode_Tools
# Description 
Some times i try to making tools for better result in Cyber Security.
I'm not a professional developer but try to making easy life for other people.
Penetration testing tools are used as part of a penetration test(Pen Test) to automate certain tasks, improve testing efficiency and discover issues that might be difficult to find using manual analysis techniques alone. 
Two common penetration testing tools are static analysis tools and dynamic analysis tools. Wolfi_PyCode_tools focus in tools in IT & Security field.

# Usage in
--------------------------------------------------------------------

# Network
a large system consisting of many similar parts that are connected together to allow movement or communication between or along the parts, or between the parts and a control centre(Many of these tools will be used in network)
# Penetration
A penetration test (pen test) is an authorized simulated attack performed on a computer system to evaluate its security.
Penetration testers use the same tools, techniques, and processes as attackers to find and demonstrate the business impacts of weaknesses in a system(Many of these tools will be used in web-network and mobile penetration)
# Automation
Automation is the creation and application of technologies to produce and deliver goods and services with minimal human intervention. The implementation of automation technologies, techniques and processes improve the efficiency, reliability, and/or speed of many tasks that were previously performed by humans(Many of these tools will be used for automations)


Lets be friend and help together for better future :-))))))
